        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Pupusas are thick, hand-formed corn tortillas stuffed with savory fillings, originating from El Salvador. They’re griddled until golden brown and slightly crisp on the outside, with a soft, cheesy, and flavorful interior. Pupusas are a staple of Salvadoran cuisine and are traditionally served with curtido (a tangy fermented cabbage slaw) and salsa roja (a mild tomato-based sauce).</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="list-space">
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <li>Refried beans</li>
            <li>Chicharrón (seasoned pork paste)</li>
            <li>Maseca</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol class="list-space">
            <li>Mix Maseca, water, and a pinch of salt until a smooth, pliable dough forms — like soft playdough.</li>
            <li>Prepare filling by mixing cheese, refried beans, and/or chicharrón.</li>
            <li>Lightly oil your hands and take a golf ball–sized portion of dough. Then, flatten it into a disc in your palm (about 3–4 inches wide).</li>
            <li>Place some filling in the center. </li>
            <li>Carefully fold the edges over the filling, pinch shut, then gently flatten it back into a disc — try not to let filling spill out.</li>
            <li>Cook over a skillet until golden brown.</li>
            <li>Top or serve with curtido or tomato salsa</li>
        </ol>
