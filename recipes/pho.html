    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pho is a traditional Vietnamese noodle soup known for its fragrant, clear broth simmered for hours with spices, tender meat, and fresh herbs. Itâ€™s a beloved comfort food and a staple of Vietnamese cuisine, typically enjoyed as a hearty breakfast or anytime meal. The classic version features beef pho (pho bo), but there are also chicken (pho ga) and vegetarian variations.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 lbs beef bones (marrow and knuckle bones)</li>
        <li>Flat rice noodles (banh pho)</li>
        <li>Thinly sliced beef (like brisket, flank, or rare eye of round)</li>
        <li>fresh herbs (Thai basil, cilantro), bean sprouts, lime wedges, and sliced chili</li>
        <li>Hoisin sauce</li>
        <li>Sriracha</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Prepare the bones. Parboil beef bones in boiling water for 10 minutes to remove impurities. Drain and rinse.</li>
        <li>In a large pot, add cleaned bones, charred onion and ginger, spices (star anise, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, coriander), salt, sugar, and fish sauce.</li>
        <li>Fill with water (about 5-6 quarts) and simmer gently for at least 6 hours (longer for deeper flavor), skimming impurities occasionally.</li>
        <li>Soak or briefly boil the rice noodles until soft but still chewy, then drain.</li>
        <li>Place a serving of noodles in a bowl. Top with thin slices of raw beef (the hot broth will cook the meat). Ladle the hot broth over the noodles and beef.</li>
        <li>Add fresh Thai basil, bean sprouts, lime wedges, sliced chili, and sauces on the side for personal taste.</li>
    </ol>
